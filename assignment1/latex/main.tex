\subsubsection{Processing and delay}
In addition to propogation delay we have

\begin{description}
    \item[Processing delay] A delay caused by the routers in the network,
        due to the requirement of examining the packet's header information to
        determine where to direct the package. 
    \item[Queue delay] If more packets are going into the same link, the
        router forms a queue, where a packet is hold until it is
        transmitted, this delay is called a queue delay.
    \item[Tranmission delay] The time required to push all of the packet's bits
        into the link. This is often the most most significant delay.
