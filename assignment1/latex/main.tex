\section{Theoretical part}
\subsection{Store and Forward}
\subsubsection{Processing and delay}
In addition to propogation delay we have

\begin{description}
    \item[Processing delay] A delay caused by the routers in the network,
        due to the requirement of examining the packet's header information to
        determine where to direct the package.
    \item[Queue delay] If more packets are going into the same link, the
        router forms a queue, where a packet is hold until it is
        transmitted, this delay is called a queue delay.
    \item[Tranmission delay] The time required to push all of the packet's bits
        into the link. This is often the most most significant delay.
\end{description}

\subsection{Buffers and latency}
\begin{description}
    \item[Part 1] The link behind the DSL modem is limited to 54 Mb/s by the wireless connection,
        but is significantly faster than the 2Mb/s upload speed of the modem. Given a continuous
        upload burst it will be filled in approx. 78.7 milliseconds, leading to further packets being
        dropped. This results in a maximum packet delay that is infinite. All packets from the student
        will then be discarded.
    \item[Part 2] The \emph{Bandwith-delay product} can be seen as a measurement of the
        ``volume'' of the network link, describing how much data that can be on the link at
        any point in time.
        TODO: Why good measure, and what are consequences?
\end{description}

\subsection{HTTP}
\subsubsection{HTTP semantics}
\subsubsection{HTTP headers and fingerprinting}

\subsubsection{The case of Deep Packet Inspection}
\begin{description}
    \item[Part 1] '3' could have filtered all requests to \texttt{grooveshark.com} by dropping all packets
        with a destination host being an IP belonging to that domain. This could be done in the network layer without
        breaking the layering model of the network stack.
    \item[Part 2] This is a violation of layering in networks because a layer is inspecting and modifying
        the data passing in a layer above it. To stop this and enforce the layering we may encrypt the HTTP
        stream by using HTTPS (SSL).
