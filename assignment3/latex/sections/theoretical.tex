\subsubsection{Addresses and network masks}
\begin{description}
    \item[Part 1.1:] From a router's point of view the purpose of network masks is to
        reduce the size of the forwarding table. Because all IP addresses in the same network
        have the same prefix, a router only needs to store the prefix.
    \item[Part 1.2:] Network masks may be expressed in the same dotted quad notation
        that IP addresses are expressed in (because they are also 4 bytes long).
        255.225.255.0 is not a valid network mask, because it is not a continuous
        prefix of 1-bits. In the slash-notation we would interpret /28 as a prefix
        of 28 1-bits, or the network mask 255.255.255.240.
    \item[Part 1.3:] The difference is that the network prefix was constrained to be of length
        8, 16 or 24 bits in classful addressing, and can be of any length in classless
        interdomain routing.
    \item[Part 1.4:] The network address is simply the IP anded with the network mask (byte form),
        and the broadcast address is the network address plus \\$2^{32-\text{prefixlength}} - 1$.
        The size of the network is $2^{\text{prefixlength}} - 2$ (subtracting 2 for the network
        and broadcast address). The available addresses are found in the interval between the network
        and broadcast address.
